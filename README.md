# Catalog-of-my-things
In this project, we will create a console app that will help you to keep a record of different types of things you own: books, music albums, movies, and games. Everything will be based on the UML class diagram presented below. The data will be stored in JSON files but we will also prepare a database with tables structure analogical to our program's class structure.
